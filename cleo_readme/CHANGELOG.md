## 4.3.23

- Now you can use string pointer in the file address parameter for .ini files opcodes.

- Fixed many things which use the 'SCM Block' or 'Mission Local Storage' space
- Fixed parameters being passed to script local storage instead of mission local storage through 0A94
- Fixed potential problems with iteration through the script queues (may cause rare and hard to trace bugs)

## 4.3.13

- Fixed crashing when starting a new game after a game has already started with CLEO scripts installed
- Possibly fixed other issues with starting a game with CLEO scripts installed

## 4.3.12.1

- Un-did the 'Scripts no longer load prematurely' fix as it caused scripts to not load certain circumstances (like before CLEO 4)
- Included 'cleo_text' folder in installation

- Fixed string parameter skipping in 'SkipOpcodeParams' used by CLEO plugins
- 0AC8 now returns a NULL value to the output var if allocation failed (as it did before 4.3a)
- 0AC9 now checks the memory was allocated by 0AC8 before attempting to free it
- FXT references are now case insensitive (as they were before 4.3a)

## 4.3.9

- Will now be able to start a CLEO mission after recently finishing a standard mission
- Will no longer error & terminate when scripts fail to open and instead simply log the error
- Will no longer terminate on warnings

- Improved handling of script load errors

## 4.3.8

- Fixed crash which would occur when missions were ended with 004E

## 4.3.7

- Custom missions launched by CLEO scripts now inherit their compatibility mode - possibly fixing incompatibilities with mods using custom missions
- The current directory set by 0A99 is now script-dependant and only affects running CLEO scripts (not the entire game or the main.scm)
- Text and texture/sprite draws are now script-dependant (doesn't affect main.scm scripts)

## 4.3.0

- Replaced code which dynamically allocated and deallocated memory for script parameters every time 0AA5-0AA8 were called with static arrays
- Removed a script execution loop replacement which wasn't used for anything important and weirdly only worked with 1.0US that caused crashes with script logging plugins
- Added support for Steam (v3) versions of gta_sa.exe
- Prevented the local storage from being initialized in SCM functions when the script is in CLEO 3 compatibility mode ('.cs3' extension)

### Updates to behaviour of following opcodes:

#### 0A99

CHANGE_DIRECTORY can now correctly change to the program directory

#### 0A9A

OPEN_FILE now uses a 'legacy' mode when passing an integer as the mode parameter for compatibility of CLEO file handles and SA file handles
Note that you should really not pass CLEO file handles to game functions. However, this legacy mode now ensures that the handles are compatible.
Other file functions have also been updated ensuring that game file handles are passed to relevant game functions.
It is recommended to not rely on passing files to game functions and instead use CLEO 4's in-built file functions in future.

#### 0AD1

CALL now accepts string input, which is passed as a string pointer following string convention

#### 0AD4

SCAN_STRING now returns a condition result

#### 0AE6

FIND_FIRST_FILE now accepts string array output

#### 0AE3

FIND_ALL_RANDOM_OBJECTS_IN_SPHERE now ensures no fading objects are returned and returns -1 instead of 0 on failure

#### 0AE2

FIND_ALL_RANDOM_CARS_IN_SPHERE now ensures no script vehicles or fading vehicle are returned and returns -1 instead of 0 on failure

#### 0AE1

FIND_ALL_RANDOM_CHARS_IN_SPHERE now ensures no script characters or fading characters are returned and returns -1 instead of 0 on failure

#### 0ADF

ADD_TEXT_LABEL now updates existing text labels if they already exist

#### 0AD6

IS_END_OF_FILE_REACHED now returns true if a file error occured

#### 0AD2

GET_CHAR_PLAYER_IS_TARGETING now returns -1 instead of 0 when no target is found

#### 0AB5

STORE_CLOSEST_ENTITIES now ensures no script entities or fading entities are returned and ensures the player ped is not returned
